## 📌 Overview
SC2006 School Picker is a **web-based application** designed to assist parents and students in finding suitable schools based on various criteria. This project was developed as part of the **SC2006 Software Engineering** module at NTU.

### Problem Statement
Parents and students often struggle to find the right school due to:
- Limited and scattered information.
- Lack of **comparability features**.
- **Decision fatigue** from overwhelming choices.

### 🎯 Solution
Our **School Picker** application provides:
- **A centralized school search tool** with filtering and comparison features.
- **A user-friendly forum** for discussions and shared experiences.
- **A recommendation system** that suggests schools based on user preferences.
